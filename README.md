## üîß Configure

Write markdown files in `content` folder.

Open `config.js` for templating variables. Broadly configuration is available for `gatsby`, `header`, `sidebar` and `siteMetadata`.

- `gatsby` config for global configuration like
    - `pathPrefix` - Gatsby Path Prefix
    - `siteUrl` - Gatsby Site URL
    - `gaTrackingId` - Google Analytics Tracking ID

- `header` config for site header configuration like
    - `title` - The title that appears on the top left
    - `githubUrl` - The Github URL for the docs website
    - `helpUrl` - Help URL for pointing to resources
    - `tweetText` - Tweet text
    - `links` - Links on the top right
    - `search` - Enable search and [configure Algolia](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/adding-search-with-algolia/)

- `sidebar` config for navigation links configuration
    - `forcedNavOrder` for left sidebar navigation order. It should be in the format "/<filename>"
    - `frontLine` - whether to show a front line at the beginning of a nested menu.(Collapsing capability would be turned of if this option is set to true)
    - `links` - Links on the bottom left of the sidebar
    - `ignoreIndex` - Set this to true if the index.md file shouldn't appear on the left sidebar navigation. Typically this can be used for landing pages.

- `siteMetadata` config for website related configuration
    - `title` - Title of the website
    - `description` - Description of the website
    - `ogImage` - Social Media share og:image tag
    - `docsLocation` - The Github URL for Edit on Github

- For sub nesting in left sidebar, create a folder with the same name as the top level `.md` filename and the sub navigation is auto-generated. The sub navigation is alphabetically ordered.

## Live Code Editor

To render react components for live editing, add the `react-live=true` to the code section. For example:

```javascript react-live=true
<button>Edit my text</button>
```

In the above code, just add `javascript react-live=true` after the triple quote ``` to start rendering react components that can be edited by users.

## ü§ñ SEO friendly

This is a static site and comes with all the SEO benefits. Configure meta tags like title and description for each markdown file using MDX Frontmatter

```markdown
---
title: "Title of the page"
metaTitle: "Meta Title Tag for this page"
metaDescription: "Meta Description Tag for this page"
---
```

Canonical URLs are generated automatically.
